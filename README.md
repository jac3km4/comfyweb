## ComfyWeb

This project is an attempt to build a powerful, versatile and convenient Stable Diffusion web UI. I've developed it along with my fork of the amazing [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) where I've done some changes and added some features (GFPGAN etc). The UI features a React-based workflow editor with real-time progress bars, a queue system, a gallery, a node picker and a workflow manager.

**This project is alpha quality**

## installation

- clone my branch with a pre-built frontend
  ```
  git clone -b new-ui-and-feats https://github.com/jac3km4/ComfyUI
  ```
- follow the README.md instructions there

## features

Supports almost everything that ComfyUI does (SD1, SD2, Textual Inversion, Loras), plus a few more things like LORA prompts, upscaling and face correction.
