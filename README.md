# ComfyWeb
ComfyWeb is a simple interface for ComfyUI that replaces graphs with beautiful forms.

## Features
- A simple and intuitive interface with HTML forms instead of graphs! You can easily create and
  edit workflows without having to worry about the underlying graph structure.
- A unified gallery view that allows you to easily preview, edit and manage both generated images as
  well as anything that's pending in the queue.
- Drag and drop support for ComfyUI images and workflows, they are be automatically converted
  to a simple sequence of forms (some complex graphs might be rejected). Images generated
  with ComfyWeb can be loaded with ComfyUI (although they're not guaranteed to be pretty!).

## Usage
This project builds into a single HTML file.
